Here’s a longer text chunk, clearly laying out all your issues, requests, and expectations for BloxBetter:

After going through the setup process, I’ve run into multiple issues that need fixing to ensure everything works smoothly and reliably:

Step 3: Channel Configuration

After I complete Step 3, nothing happens—the setup doesn’t seem to do anything or activate any features. Channel configuration appears broken or unfinished and should be fixed to work as intended.

Step 4: Custom Bot Configuration

Entering my bot token does not make my bot go online. This setup step does not work; the bot remains offline. Please fix this so the bot reliably connects after entering the token.

Roblox API Keys

The API key integration is not functioning as expected. Even after entering my Roblox API key and going to the bans section, banning a player in-game fails—the player is not banned and nothing happens. This must be fixed so bans work as designed via the panel.

Branding & Appearance (Game Profile)

There needs to be a clear and usable section for setting up branding and profile appearance for my game page. This should include:

Game Name (required field)

Vanity URL (with info about needing premium for custom links)

Short Description (required, should allow a brief summary)

Appearance (options to personalize with an icon and banner)

Game Icon (upload or change: PNG, JPG, GIF, up to 10MB)

Game Banner (upload/drag: PNG, JPG, GIF, up to 10MB)

All of these branding and profile options must be functional and work properly.

Ticket Categories

The ticket categories feature is broken. When I try to add a category, it claims “submitted,” yet the category is not shown anywhere—the list stays empty and unusable. Categories should appear after submission so support tickets can be organized.

Overall Goal

All features and configurations should not just exist, but work smoothly and reliably. Fix bugs, ensure each component activates/updates when used, and make sure everything is functional and user-friendly.
