Design & Style Fixes

First off, no more light colors for the homepage—ditch anything white or “emo,” and keep your OG pink style, especially for the dashboard buttons and important UI highlights.

The color UI should stay that nice, clean gray—no black and definitely no white, just like the style of your RoModerate icon.

For emoji icons, switch the default white color to your signature pink just like the branding; everything should match RoModerate’s vibe, not look bland or out of place.

RoModerate Page Updates

The RoModerate page should have more going on—not just basic moderator/ban appeal stuff.

Make the page like a split: half focused on moderation tools and community safety, and half on the marketplace, so users see both worlds.

Dashboard bugs: go through and rework anything that’s messy, glitchy, or not matching the main style. Make sure it’s smooth and user-friendly.

Marketplace Dashboard Features & Ideas

The marketplace dashboard should be separate from ban appeals and moderation.

Make sure to show users’ Discord icons and usernames as soon as they log in so it feels personalized.

Marketplace sections need more features:

User profile cards with Discord avatar, role, and verified badge if available.

Let users track their listings, purchases, sales history, and earned credits.

Sort/filter options that actually work for UGC, game passes, plugins, 3D models, etc.

Live notifications for new bids, offers, or comments on users’ items

Seller ratings/reviews for trust and transparency

“Featured sellers” or “Top items” rotating spotlights on the homepage

“Recommended for you” sidebar, powered by item type and user history

Trending and newest sections auto-updating

Escrow service details: explain how it keeps transactions safe for buyers AND sellers.

Marketplace help/tips section for new sellers

In-app support + dispute resolution through Discord integration

Marketplace Listing Features

Listings must let users upload thumbnails, descriptions, multiple item types

Enable image upload for listings: make it work with live previews, size checks, and drag-drop

Set up “Coming soon” for any future features, but also keep the main upload working for now

Add “report listing” and moderation tools to keep marketplace clean

Terms of Service, Policy, & Legal

Create a full Terms of Service for marketplace/ban appeals.

Show the TOS before listing or buying ANY item; users must click “I have read and agree” to continue—no exceptions.

Include Marketplace rules, liability info, user responsibility for uploaded content, prohibited items, how escrow works, user safety policies, and copyright/IP protection.

Privacy Policy section to explain data handling, Discord login, and seller/buyer info privacy.

Give a compliance banner: “By using RoMarket, you acknowledge and accept all marketplace rules—violations may result in account action.”

How Should Marketplace Work?

Sellers post listings (UGC items, passes, plugins, etc.), set prices, upload images, write descriptions.

Buyers log in with Discord, browse categories, and use credits or direct purchases (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)

Escrow system: funds are held until buyer receives the item (or confirms trade in Discord); then, funds are released to the seller.

Ratings/reviews for every transaction, with dispute support via marketplace and Discord mods.

Seller fees or commissions for marketplace upkeep—display these transparently before listing.

Leaderboards or achievements for sellers with the most sales, best reviews, etc.

Seasonal or event-based marketplace themes (Match with RoModerate’s pink style and holiday events).

Integrate notifications for bids, sales, and support tickets.

Extra Design & Experience Ideas

Use more visual cues—badges, icons, animated elements—with your pink as the accent color across the whole platform.

Make sure there’s never a bland or empty area; fill space with guides, latest items, “get started” prompts, or top tips.

Let users customize their dashboard backgrounds or themes—again, pink styles, matching RoModerate branding.

Summary
Your marketplace needs to match your energetic RoModerate branding—no bland gray/black or “emo” white! Make everything pink/gray themed, focus marketplace features on user profiles, escrow safety, live notifications, seller reviews, and separate moderation/ban appeal stuff. Create full TOS/Policy with a required “agree” button, and build out image uploads, notifications, support, leaderboards, and design improvements—not just plain buy/sell. Keep expanding—every idea above can be built in and iterated on!
