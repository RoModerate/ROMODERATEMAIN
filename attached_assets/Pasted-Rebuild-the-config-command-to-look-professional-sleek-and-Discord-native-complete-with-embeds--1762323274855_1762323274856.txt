Rebuild the /config command to look professional, sleek, and Discord-native — complete with embeds, watermark styling, select menus, and proper database syncing with the web dashboard.

🧩 CONFIG COMMAND OVERVIEW

Command: /config
Purpose: The central hub for all bot and server setup configuration.

🖌️ Design Guidelines

Use Discord-style embeds with a professional watermark and clean layout.

Use subtle emojis and dividers like:

> 🛠️ | Configuration Panel
> 💾 | Status: Not Set
> 🌐 | Link Key Required


Footer example: RoModerate • Powered by Discord

Color theme: Discord blue / blurple gradient (#5865F2)

🔑 LINK SYSTEM

Before using /config, users must link their server via the web dashboard.

On the website, under Server Settings, generate a Link Key using /linkkey.

Enter that key inside Discord using:

/linkkey <key>


Once verified, /config will unlock and load their saved server data from the database.

If the server is not linked, /config should show an embed:

> ⚠️ | This server is not linked.
> Please visit your dashboard and generate a Link Key first.
> Once done, run /linkkey <key> to connect this server.

⚙️ CONFIG MENU STRUCTURE

Once linked, /config opens a professional embed:

🛠️ RoModerate Configuration Panel
> Select a category below to begin setup.
> All settings automatically sync between web and bot.

💾 Status: Synced with Web Dashboard
🔗 Server ID: 1234567890


Embed includes a dropdown menu for all categories:

Reports Settings

Appeals Settings

Moderation Logs

Tickets & Support

Roblox / Game Data

Server Settings

Each dropdown selection opens a new embed with all settings for that category (e.g., channels, roles, toggles).

Each setting should:

Show current status (✅ Set / ❌ Not Set)

Have buttons for “Set Channel”, “Set Role”, “Toggle”, “Edit”, etc.

Save updates directly to the database, reflecting on both the bot and website instantly.

🧱 DATABASE SYNC LOGIC

When a setting is changed from Discord:

Update the server’s database record

Auto-sync with the web dashboard

Show a “✅ Saved successfully!” message briefly

Example structure in DB:

{
  "serverId": "1234567890",
  "linked": true,
  "reports": {
    "channel": "1212121212",
    "pingRole": "1313131313",
    "banStrings": true,
    "logs": "1414141414"
  },
  "appeals": {
    "category": "1515151515",
    "logs": "1616161616",
    "deniedRole": "1717171717"
  }
}

🌐 WEB ↔ DISCORD SYNC

All configurations must mirror between:

Website Dashboard (Server Settings, Reports Settings, Appeals Settings, etc.)

Discord Bot /config Command

Users can choose to configure via:

Web Dashboard
or

Directly inside Discord using /config

Both methods update the same database entry.

🧠 EXTRA FIXES

Fix “Failed to search player. Please try again.” in /user-search.

Fix “Create Panel” button (currently does nothing).

Set up proper DATABASE_URL connection (Replit Secrets).

Prevent auto logout when refreshing the web dashboard.

Make sure all database entries sync correctly across sessions.

🛍️ MESSAGE TO SCORCH (for Marketplace UI)

Hey Scorch, please tell Replit AI to remove the countdown UI from the Marketplace section — I need to start working on it manually now.

✅ Summary

Build Goals:

1 unified /config command with dropdown embeds and Discord-style design

Full link system using /linkkey

Database sync between bot and website

Professional interface with watermark and “Not Set” indicators

Smooth, modern UX for both developers and staff
