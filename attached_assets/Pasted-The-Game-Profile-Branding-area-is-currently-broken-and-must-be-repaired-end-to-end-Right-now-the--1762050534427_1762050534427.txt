The Game Profile & Branding area is currently broken and must be repaired end-to-end. Right now the vanity URL system returns {"error":"Vanity URL not found"} even when a valid vanity value is given; fix the backend lookup and routing so that when a user sets a vanity URL it resolves correctly, persists to the database, and the UI shows a working short, friendly link (e.g., romoderate.repl.co/shortname) while actually redirecting to the full Replit URL behind the scenes. Do not require a paid/premium flag — make vanity URLs free for now. For the game icon and banner, remove the rigid “too big” rejection: the system should accept any image size the user uploads and either (a) auto-resize/compress large images on upload to safe, performant dimensions, or (b) accept the file as-is and serve it responsively — but it must not throw a size error if the user uploads an image that visually fits. Show a clear visual preview after upload and save the chosen image so it doesn’t revert on refresh. The profile page must display the final active icon/banner immediately after save.

Ticketing: when a user adds a ticket category the UI currently displays “category added” but the category never appears anywhere and the ticket panels cannot be created (panel step 4 is blocked by “You need at least one ticket category”). Fix the entire category save/display flow: categories must be created in the backend, returned to the UI in the same request, and listed in the category management view. Creating a category should immediately enable the panel creation step. Ensure categories are persisted (survive refresh, are queryable), and add defensive error messages if DB writes fail. Make the ticket-panel creation UI actually consume those categories (dropdown selection should show the newly created categories).

Onboarding & bot integration: the onboarding flow should not mark “complete” until the Discord bot is verified as present and online in the target server. Right now the bot often stays offline and the user cannot see slash commands like /linkey or /link — fix the bot connection check to actively verify that the bot is in the server and responding to gateway intents (or at least that it’s online). If the bot is offline, show a clear troubleshooting modal with steps (invite link, required permissions, intents, and a “retry” button that re-checks presence). Ensure slash commands are registered (guild/global as appropriate) and visible to server members with the required permissions. If commands aren’t registered, surface an informative error and a one-click re-register action.

Roblox integration: the Roblox API integration seems unreliable — /ban does not work. Audit the Roblox API key flow, re-validate that keys are stored, sent in requests, and that the correct Roblox endpoints and request formats are used. Add explicit success/failure handling and logs so a moderator sees why the ban failed. If the ban is accepted by Roblox, record a local action entry in the Bans section showing the Roblox username, avatar, reason, timestamp, and the moderator who issued it.

Dashboard / UX flow: replace confusing or decorative-only buttons with working features. Any UI control that does nothing currently must either be wired up or removed. For /user-search, provide a visible Dashboard button or shortcut in the UI that opens the user dashboard (so staff don’t have to type a slash command). Buttons should be semantic: if they open a modal, open it; if they call an API, show loading + success/failure. The Save button must persist settings to the server and not lose data on refresh — implement optimistic UI + server confirmation and display failures with reasons if the save fails.

Team members & roles: when inviting team members, the invitee’s avatar/icon currently doesn’t display and invites “switch” views unpredictably. Fix invites so invited users immediately appear in the Team Members list with their avatar, username, and assigned role. All members who have permission to see team lists (including owner and staff) should be able to view who is in the team and each person’s role. Invitations should not flip the UI into onboarding or hide critical pages; invited staff must not see /onboarding or server configuration pages unless they are owner/admin with those permissions. Invitations should also be idempotent (don’t duplicate entries) and must include clear states: invited/pending/accepted/declined. Prevent role/permission flicker by ensuring permission states are fetched afresh after any change.

Permissions UI: in Reports and Appeal Settings, add a proper Discord role-selection area. Instead of typing IDs or free text, present an authenticated dropdown/list of roles fetched from the user’s Discord guild (after the bot is confirmed in the server and has MANAGE_ROLES/VIEW_CHANNEL as needed). These role selectors should control who can: appeal, respond to appeals, view reports, file reports, or be excluded from appeals. Make these selectors intuitive (checkboxes or multi-select) and save them to server-side config. For appeal workflows, when a user runs /appeal in Discord, the platform should capture the appeal, show a notification in the dashboard with the user’s Roblox username and avatar, and insert the appeal into the Bans/Appeals queue. Moderators must be able to claim an appeal (claim action changes its state and prevents other staff from duplicating work) and then resolve or escalate it.

Notification UI & command mapping: implement the notification panel so Discord-triggered events (appeals, reports, bans) are shown in real-time (or near real-time). For each notification show Roblox name + icon, Discord mention, timestamp, reason, and quick action buttons (Claim, Assign, Dismiss). When clicked, these actions must call server APIs that change the item’s state and are reflected immediately in the UI for all staff. Also ensure that when a staff member is added/invited, they do not see server configuration options unless their role explicitly grants it.

Miscellaneous bug cleanup: remove or wire up any decorative-only or dead buttons; run a component audit and fix missing handlers or missing API endpoints. Add validation and clear error messages for failed operations. Ensure image avatars load (with graceful fallback), all lists refresh after CRUD operations, and all server-side errors are returned with useful messages so the front end can surface them. Ensure CSRF/auth tokens and session persistence aren’t causing transient failures on save. Add client-side and server-side logging so developers can repro and trace the source of failures.

Acceptance criteria (what “done” looks like):
• Vanity URLs resolve and show a working short link; the UI shows the short link and clicking it redirects to the full Replit URL.
• Icon and banner uploads accept any size image, auto-handle it, preview it, and persist after save/refresh.
• Ticket categories can be created, listed, and selected in panel creation; step 4 panel creation no longer blocks if categories exist.
• Bot must be verified in the guild before onboarding completes; slash commands (e.g., /link, /appeal) must be registered and usable.
• /ban command works consistently with Roblox and records successful ban entries in Bans with user/avatar/time/mod.
• Dashboard button replaces /user-search; Save persists settings and survives page reloads.
• Team invites show avatars and roles immediately; invited staff cannot access onboarding/config unless allowed; invitation states are consistent.
• Reports/Appeal settings use real Discord role selectors (fetched from guild) rather than typed IDs.
• Notification UI shows Roblox name + icon for appeals/reports, supports claim/assign, and prevents duplicate handling.
• All decorative/nonfunctional buttons removed or implemented; no major UI actions are inert.
