In the dashboard, I can’t see /reports, and on the home page, I need a Moderator Portal button for moderators to access their area directly. In the Team Members section, instead of a regular “Add Member” button, make it an “Invitation System.” It should ask for the user’s ID, show their Discord icon and name, and then let the developer assign a role. Add extra high-level roles called “Co-Owner” and maybe one more rank below that. After assigning the role, it generates an invitation code. The developer can set the code’s expiration time — like 1 day, 30 minutes, 1 minute, or 30 seconds. When the invited user joins through that link, they automatically get the assigned role and access to the moderation panel after logging in with Discord.
For the dashboard setup, especially for “New Reports Channel,” make sure developers can select the channel. When a new developer joins and clicks “Get Started,” it should show a setup screen first — requiring them to go through “Server Settings” and “Manage Server.” A setup UI should pop up asking for the server channel ID, Discord bot token, and any other required info. During setup, they shouldn’t be able to click or access other dashboard sections (like moderation or configuration) until setup is complete.
For the Discord bot setup, the developer must provide their client ID. Instead of a redirect URI, make it so that in “Server Configuration,” the owner gets a unique “Bot Key.” This key should be hidden at all costs from the public and regular members — only the owner and co-owner can access it. That key connects the user’s Discord bot to RoModerate. The bot should activate using a custom slash command (like /linkkey or something unique) where the owner enters their key to connect the bot with the web panel.
In the configuration area, add a “Ticket Setup” section where the owner can fully configure support tickets for their bot. They should be able to enable, disable, and customize ticket categories and responses. Also, in the same configuration area, allow the developer to create a custom Ban Appeal system — they can enter their own Ban Appeal API or webhook link, which will then show ban appeal logs inside the dashboard. After setup, show a link that the developer can copy for use in their server or game to connect with the appeal system.
