RoModerate System & Website Audit – Initial Findings
Overview
All major dashboard and admin panel sections of RoModerate (Moderation Panel, User Search, Bans, Appeals, Tickets, Logs, Team Members, Settings, etc.) were systematically reviewed for errors, missing features, and UX issues as required.

Section-by-Section Audit Summary
Moderation Panel

All core moderation actions and navigation options are surfaced in the sidebar ().​

User Search & Logs

Sections load, but there is no evidence of advanced search tools, filters, or audit trail entries for persistent moderation logging ().​

Bans & Appeals

Ban and appeal sections exist, but no open or historic entries were found; unclear if persistence is live or stubbed ().​

Expected features like viewing, filtering, and bulk actions on bans are not surfaced.

No indication of clear ban/appeal status or rejection/approval workflows.

Tickets/Support

Ticket panel and ticket setup pages present (); unable to validate full ticket creation/assignment/closure functionality or form validation without test data.​

No evidence of data persistence or logs of ticket activity.

Team Members & Auto Actions

Pages render but seem to lack granular permission controls or role management insights ().​

Bot Commands

Commands page exists but lists and configuration details are unclear ().​

Settings (Reports, Tickets, Appeals, API Keys, Game Profile, Server Settings, etc.)

Setting and configuration panels exist with accessible navigation ().​

No schema visualization, data preview, or real-time validation messaging.

API Keys page provides interface for management, but usage/audit logs are missing.

General UX/Flow

Navigation and sidebar links are surfaced across all pages (,,).​

Major moderation and admin features are discoverable but often lack visible data, activity, or error feedback.

Some panels state “Coming Soon,” potentially indicating incomplete implementation.

No evidence of responsive behavior or explicit form/client-side error validation.

Session/auth appears to rely on Discord OAuth, but security and edge-case handling could not be verified.

Immediate Gaps & Concerns
Ticket panel, ban, and appeal flows: No visible real or test data—cannot confirm working state or persistence.

Missing: Filtering, sorting, logs, assignment, and activity audit trails.

Unclear slash command registration/testing status for Discord bot.

No visible logging or error messages surfaced in UI for failed actions.

Limited settings validation, input restrictions, and authentication controls.

Next Steps:

Test ticket/ban flows, data saving, and all Discord bot commands if accessible.

Audit backend logic/data to confirm where persistence is implemented or missing.

Map missing UX/persistence/validation pieces, then proceed to new feature recommendations, database/wiring, and Blox.Report-inspired flows.

Would you like to proceed to backend/source code audit, or tackle ticket/ban system end-to-end functional testing firstst?

add extra stuff my romoderate website alright has the designs etc

Here are extra enhancements and advanced features you can add to your RoModerate website (since you already have good design and UI):

1. Analytics & Insights

Detailed stats on total reports, appeals, approved/dismissed actions (mirroring the "Statistics" and "Analytics" panels in Blox.report).

Report/appeal analytics by period (month/week), with approval and dismissal breakdowns.

2. Advanced Moderation Navigation

Quick-access sidebar with links to Dashboard, Intelligence/Analytics, Branding, Reports Settings, Appeals Settings, Roblox API Bans, API Keys, Premium features (even if only some are implemented, helps with future-proofing or tiering).

3. Branding/Customization Hooks

Let server admins upload icons, banners, and descriptions to personalize their moderation pages (seen in Blox.report's Branding).

4. API Keys Management

Let users and admins securely generate and revoke API keys.

Warning/reminder about securing and not sharing keys.

5. Upgrade Tiers/Premium Info

Add premium feature placeholders, showing what users could unlock (even before building those features out).

6. Stats Dashboard

Include graphs and charts for reports and appeal outcomes over time.

Approved/dismissed color legends and visual analytics.

7. Empty State Guidance

When no data is present ("No reports found :("), show tips or call-to-action to bring the bot to their server, or demo/test commands.

8. Roblox API Bans Integration

Optionally, integrations with Roblox APIs for ban/appeal lookups, if relevant to your community.

9. Security and Roles

Enforce role-based access for critical actions and API management.

Add 2FA or additional login validations for admins.

10. Detailed Logs and Exports

Let admins export logs, appeals, and ban histories as CSV or PDF for record-keeping.

All these features borrow inspiration from Blox.report structure, but expand your RoModerate project with both immediate utility and longer-term scaling in mind. Let me know if you want step-by-step recommendations or technical implementation advice for any item!
