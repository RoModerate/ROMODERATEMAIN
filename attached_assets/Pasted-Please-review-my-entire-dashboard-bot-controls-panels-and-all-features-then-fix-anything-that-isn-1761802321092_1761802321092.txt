Please review my entire dashboard, bot controls, panels, and all features—then fix anything that isn’t working, is buggy, or can be improved. Here’s a full list based on what I see and need:

General Reliability:

Make every dashboard area and command (including moderation and bot actions) work smoothly for people. No bugs, no downtime, easy for users.

Go through each dashboard section and panel—if anything is slow or unreliable, fix it so everything runs 24/7, even offline if possible.

Make sure all functionalities connect and respond (no buttons doing nothing, all links and logins work).

Specific Fixes Needed:

Ticket Panel: This isn’t working—please troubleshoot it and make it fully functional. It should let users open, manage, and close tickets with no issues.

Bot Token/Step 4 Panel: The bot doesn’t go online or connect—please fix this so it always starts up and comes online, even after a crash or reboot.

Moderation Panel: Improve it so all moderation commands and actions (ban, mute, etc.) run reliably and give user feedback.

Duplicate Areas: Check for any duplicate panels, buttons, or menu items—remove or merge to keep things clean.

Confirm every link is correct and removes unused/old ones, especially Discord URLs or callback links.

Fix any errors about invalid OAuth2 or missing code/state.

Security and Setup:

Move all secrets out of plain .env files to Replit Secrets and document which secrets are needed, like Discord bot token, client secret, session secret, etc.

If Replit’s domain or redirect URL changes, make it auto-updates everywhere, especially Discord login and invite URLs.

The bot invite link should not include redirect_uri or response_type.

Names and Navigation:

Rename “Player Lookup” to something simple and general; ideas: “User Search”, “Account Finder”, or “Member Info”. Choose whichever sounds best or suggest another.

Standardize all panel names and button texts for clarity—no typos or confusing terms.

Ideas for New Features:

Add a Setup/Admin tab that shows current bot/connect status, missing secrets, and copy buttons for necessary Discord URLs.

Add a permissions calculator/GUI to set bot permissions without mistakes.

Add an in-app “Health Check” for secrets, redirect, panel readiness—shows pass/fail for each.

Help/Docs sidebar: Show quick help and troubleshooting, not just an external file.

Audit log for any settings changes (no secrets, just what changed and when).

Add buttons for “Open Login Flow” and “Bot Invite”—opens a new tab to check the correct link live.

User Experience:

Add friendly error screens if logins or commands fail, telling users what to do next.

Every dashboard page should say if something’s missing or not ready, showing clear steps to fix it.

Make sure loading states, feedback messages, and instructions are clear for new users.

Cleanup Tasks:

Remove any root-level REDIRECT_URI config file (use one source of truth, preferably auto-generated).

Keep only .env.template (no real secrets committed).

Remove hardcoded or broken links.

Make all changes to logs and error reports clear and safe (no secret leakage).

Please go through everything above and confirm fixes for each, and let me know if anything’s missing or can be improved further!
