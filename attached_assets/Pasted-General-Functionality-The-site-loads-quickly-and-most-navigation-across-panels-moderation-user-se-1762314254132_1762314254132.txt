General Functionality
The site loads quickly and most navigation across panels (moderation, user search, bans, support tickets, etc.) works without major delays.

The Help & FAQ page displays all the basic tabs and getting started guides. The layout is understandable.

Moderation & User Search
Moderation Panel, Bans, Appeals, and tickets are present and clickable.

User Search sometimes fails with “Failed to search player. Please try again”—error handling needs improvement and clearer messaging for users.

Devs should be able to share ban logs (as you suggested): showing the game, username, and ban date in the user search log if enabled by the owner would be a valuable feature.

Configuration & Setup
Bot Commands and Help/FAQ are easy to find.

Server Settings, Game Profile, Category/Channel assignments are visible but the link between channels and categories isn’t clear during ticket panel setup.

Major problem: When you try to use Create Ticket Panel and submit, sometimes nothing happens — this must be fixed. Make sure channels/categories are connected and submitting creates a visible panel in the selected spot.

Branding & Profile
The Game Profile & Branding sections need more polish—branding tools should be easy to access with obvious options for customization, images, descriptions, and links.

Suggestions & Improvements
Go through all the moderation/configuration screens and trigger each feature in different scenarios to check for edge cases and error messages.

Improve error handling in user search, ticketing, and database-dependent sections. Always give users a clear message and helpful next actions.

For ticket setup, after selecting a category, show a confirmation that the ticket panel/channel is created. Add progress indicators or confirmation modals.

Add an overview page showing system status, error logs, and health stats (so admins catch problems quickly).

Make developer features like ban-sharing toggleable in settings, with privacy explanations.

Consider adding tooltips or help bubbles beside tricky features.

Fix the DATABASE_URL/environment variable prompt and test relogin flows so user sessions are preserved after updates.

Final Thoughts
The core idea and architecture are right—moderation, user search, bans, tickets, support, and config all in one place.

Major priorities:

Patch up database issues and error handling.

Make user-facing panels reliable with visible success on submits.

Fine-tune Game Profile & Branding options.

Deliver clear messages and make setup/confirmation feel smooth.
