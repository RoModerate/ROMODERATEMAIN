For Discord authentication, use the following redirect and bot invite URLs. Login Redirect URL: https://533cb3c5-12f4-48f2-a070-15905cce02ca-00-12va58ajgkfye.worf.replit.dev/api/auth/discord/callback. Generated OAuth2 Login URL: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1431894445623607367&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F533cb3c5-12f4-48f2-a070-15905cce02ca-00-12va58ajgkfye.worf.replit.dev%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fdiscord%2Fcallback&scope=identify+guilds. Bot Invite URL: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1431894445623607367&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2F533cb3c5-12f4-48f2-a070-15905cce02ca-00-12va58ajgkfye.worf.replit.dev%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fdiscord%2Fcallback&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands. In Step 4, fix the issue where entering a Discord bot token doesn’t bring the bot online. When the user submits their token, the backend must properly store it in .env, initialize the bot immediately, and update the dashboard status to show the bot as online in real time. The /linkkey command must fully function and properly sync all configuration and moderation data between the Discord bot and the website dashboard. Add a “Dashboard” button inside the Moderation category to let users quickly view moderation activity, reports, bans, and appeals. In Server Settings, separate servers into two sections: Enabled Servers (servers already connected) and Not Enabled Servers (servers requiring onboarding). When a server is not enabled, trigger an onboarding setup automatically. In the Moderation area, create a Shift Start feature so moderators can start and end shifts and log them. Under Configuration, include a Shift Log section that tracks moderator sessions, and add a Server Insights area to display analytics, team performance, and moderation data. Rebuild the Ticket Setup system completely to function like Ticket Tool — it must allow users to create fully customizable ticket panels, choose categories, define buttons (Close, Claim, Delete, etc.), and send the ticket panel to any chosen channel using either the custom user bot or the RoModerate bot. Ensure the Advanced Settings section works perfectly and includes options such as disabling the support server link, setting max reports per day, toggling notifications, enabling or disabling logging, and selecting allowed evidence services (YouTube, Medal, etc.). All bot commands must be fully integrated and functional with the dashboard, including /audits (subcommands: embed, graph) for viewing user logs, /blocklist (subcommands: add, remove) for managing restricted users, /commands to list all available commands, /config (subcommands: newreport, reportlogs, appealcategory, appeallogs, role, pingrole, banstring, settings) to configure moderation and system settings, /evidence to fetch linked evidence, /legal to display Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, /panel (subcommands: edit, send) to manage ticket/report panels, and /stats to display real-time server statistics.

Integrate Roblox moderation by using Roblox’s Open Cloud API at the endpoint /cloud/v2/universes/{UNIVERSE_ID}/user-restrictions/{USER_ID} with the required x-api-key header and JSON content. When issuing a ban, send a PATCH request containing a gameJoinRestriction object with active: true, privateReason, displayReason, and excludeAltAccounts: true to ensure Roblox automatically restricts alt accounts. Optionally include a duration field for temporary bans. Use a two-layer alt detection system: Roblox’s built-in alt restriction through excludeAltAccounts: true and a server-side verification process that checks known alt lists, shared IPs, recent account creation, and in-game evidence before applying a ban. Every successful ban (status 200 or 201) must be recorded in the dashboard, logging the moderator, reason, duration, timestamp, and alt-detection status. Failed bans should display clear errors for review or retry. When a moderator issues a ban via the dashboard or Discord slash command, show a confirmation modal with ban details and duration options. Automatically log all ban actions, notify other moderators, and sync them with the appeals system. Provide a “Revoke Ban” feature that sends a follow-up request to lift the restriction if an appeal is approved. Store all request and response data (including alt-detection evidence) securely for audit and appeal review. Handle rate limits and API errors safely, retrying or alerting the moderator if necessary. Never expose the API key publicly; always make Roblox API calls server-side. The /ban and /unban commands must integrate fully with this Roblox API to enforce or lift restrictions directly from Discord or the web dashboard. The entire system — from login and bot token submission to tickets, moderation, shifts, Roblox API bans, alt detection, and dashboard synchronization — must operate smoothly, securely, and continuously so both the RoModerate bot and user-linked bots remain stable and online 24/7.
