For inviting the bot to a Discord server, use this link: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1431894445623607367&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fb77d77f5-dc5e-496a-b7a1-f7099792c0cd-00-1kssmpr67lkiz.picard.replit.dev%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fdiscord%2Fcallback&integration_type=0&scope=bot. In the server settings, add a new Step 4 called Discord Bot Token Setup that says: “Important: To make your bot work properly, go to Server Settings → Bot Configuration, then enter your Client ID and Discord Bot Token. Once saved, your bot will automatically connect and sync with your server.” For the team member area, when users get invited, they should be able to see bans, appeals, and reports. Make sure every invited member appears in the member list and add a join-via-code option where users can enter an invite code to request access. Their request should show as pending until approved by the owner, co-owner, or admin. Rework the ticket system completely so it supports selecting categories and setting up the ticket system properly. In the dashboard’s ticket setup area, users should be able to choose what buttons do and then click “Send Panel” to send the ticket panel to a specific channel using their own bot or the RoModerate bot. Inside the moderation area, add a Dashboard button for quick access. In configuration, add an Evidence Services section where users can select allowed evidence platforms like YouTube, Medal, Imgur, or Streamable. Also include Advanced Settings that allow disabling the support server link, setting a max number of reports per day, and enabling a functional notification UI so users get alerts when they’re invited, accepted, or assigned new actions. Ensure the entire system runs smoothly without console errors, the Discord bot stays connected properly, and all settings sync between the web dashboard, Discord bot, and team system for a seamless experience.
