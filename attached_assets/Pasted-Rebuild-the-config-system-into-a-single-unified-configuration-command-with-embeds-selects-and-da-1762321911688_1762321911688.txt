Rebuild the /config system into a single, unified configuration command with embeds, selects, and database saving.

🧠 Overview

The /config command should be the main configuration center for the bot.
It must open an interactive embed menu with a dropdown (select menu) that lets server admins configure all bot options in one place.

All configuration data (channels, roles, toggles, categories, etc.) should be saved to the server’s database — not locally. This way, settings remain persistent even after restarts.

Each config item should be editable from the embed via select menus or modals (for text input).

⚙️ Command Name

🧱 How It Works

When a user runs /config, the bot sends an embed titled
"🛠️ RoModerate Configuration Panel"
with a dropdown listing all categories above.

When the user selects a category, the bot edits the embed to show all relevant settings with:

Buttons for “Set Channel”, “Set Role”, “Toggle On/Off”, or “Edit Text”

Modal popups for input (like entering channel name formats or times)

Once a setting is changed, it should:

Update the server’s database entry (MongoDB, Prisma, etc.)

Send a small confirmation (✅ “Setting saved successfully!”)

The config should pull default data from:

Discord server categories such as:

Moderation

Appeals Settings

Reports Settings

Ticket Setup

Configuration

Server Settings

and automatically populate dropdowns with valid channel/role IDs.

🧩 Data Saving Example

Each server in the database should store configuration like:

{
  "serverId": "1234567890",
  "reportSettings": {
    "newReportsChannel": "1212121212",
    "pingRole": "1313131313",
    "banStringsEnabled": true,
    "estimatedTime": "15m",
    "reportLogs": "1414141414",
    "allowInfiniteReports": false
  },
  "appealSettings": {
    "category": "1515151515",
    "fallbackCategory": "1616161616",
    "channelNameFormat": "appeal-{username}",
    "appealLogs": "1717171717",
    "deniedRole": "1818181818",
    "premadeResponses": ["Exploiting confirmed", "Insufficient evidence"]
  },
  "moderationLogs": "1919191919",
  "auditLogs": "2020202020"
}
