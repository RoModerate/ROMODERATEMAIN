Dashboard Configuration & Features
Step 4 - Discord Bot Token Issue
When entering the bot token, it does not go online. However, when entering the token in the Server Settings, it works. Please fix this so that entering the token in the main interface also works. Additionally, fix the Server Insights section so it functions properly. Rename it to Shift Panel or a similar name for moderators to start their shift from there.

Activity Logs & Configuration
Move the activity logs to the Configuration section. Remove the /reports button and the related area. Within the Moderator section, add a /dashboard button.

Team Member Display
When inviting team members, their username and icon should be visible to everyone. Show a dot on their icon if they're online, and indicate if they're on shift or not.

Commands & UI Design
Make the commands well-designed using clean, professional Discord Markdown. Avoid using ugly emojis. I will provide well-made emojis later. Embeds should be used when necessary, such as when reporting, and should include the user's Roblox icon.

Ticket Panel
Fix the Ticket Panel so it works with channels and includes the following general options:

Command Prefix: $
Dashboard Roles: @everyone, Blox, reports, sRo, Moderate, Ticket Tool
Blacklist Roles: Any role assigned here will be unable to use commands or reactions.
Global Ticket Limit: Set a limit for open tickets across all panels.
