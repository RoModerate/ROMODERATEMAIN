Stack (recommended):

Frontend: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS for fast UI. (Server-side rendering for pages like reports.)

Backend: Node.js + Express or Next.js API routes. Use Prisma + Postgres for DB.

Realtime: Socket.IO (or Pusher) for live updates on dashboard.

Auth: NextAuth (Discord OAuth2) for user accounts and OAuth2 flows.

Hosting: Replit for dev; production-ready: Vercel (frontend) + Railway/Heroku for backend or single fullstack on Vercel with external Postgres.

Integrations:

Bloxlink API integration for Roblox/Discord cross-checks (use official endpoints/keys).

Discord: use OAuth2 bot invite (client ID + permissions) or let users link their own bot by inviting it or registering it via a webhook — never accept Discord user tokens.

Security & privacy:

Use HTTPS, store secrets in environment variables, and never log tokens.

If users host their own bot, require them to run the bot themselves and have it register with the dashboard via a signed webhook (bot posts bot_id + HMAC).

UI / Theme:

Purple-ish theme. Example color palette: #6B21A8 (deep purple), #8B5CF6, #A78BFA, accent #7C3AED, neutral #111827.

Use the icon you provided in the header and favicon: https://i.postimg.cc/Jztj77G5/image-removebg-preview-3.png.

Core features:

Landing page with "Connect with Discord" and explainers.

Dashboard with server selection, report generator, analytics (requests, success rates).

“Add Bot” flow: (a) Invite official bot (if you provide one) via OAuth2, or (b) register user’s bot via webhook token exchange (server-to-server).

BloxLink tools: search users, mass lookup, link verification, moderation helpers.

Settings: customize colors, widgets, webhook endpoints, rate limits, permissions.

Logs + audit trail per server.

Acceptance criteria / deliverables to ask Replit AI for:

Working frontend pages (landing, login via Discord OAuth, dashboard, settings).

Working backend API (user auth, server list, Bloxlink integration, bot registration webhook).

Database schema & migrations.

README with env vars and deploy steps.

Simple test user and test workflow documented.

Ready-to-paste prompt for Replit AI

Use the block below — paste it exactly into Replit AI. It explains everything the assistant should build.

Build a production-ready web app modeled after blox.report. I want a fully working prototype with the following requirements. Use Next.js + Tailwind CSS for the frontend and a Node/Next backend (Next API routes or Express) with PostgreSQL + Prisma for database ORM. Provide code, migration files, and a README with deploy steps.

Project goals

A polished, purple-themed SaaS-style dashboard where users can connect Discord and use Bloxlink features.

Use my icon for branding: https://i.postimg.cc/Jztj77G5/image-removebg-preview-3.png

Security rule: Do NOT ask users for Discord user tokens. Support safe bot connectivity using Discord OAuth2 or an explicit bot-registration webhook (server-to-server). Explain both workflows in the README.

Tech stack (must)

Frontend: Next.js (React) + Tailwind CSS

Backend: Next.js API routes or Express

DB: PostgreSQL + Prisma

Realtime: Socket.IO (for live dashboard updates)

Auth: NextAuth with Discord OAuth2 (for user login) plus JWT for API calls

Storage: use local file storage for uploads in dev, but code should be compatible with S3 for production

Environment variables: DATABASE_URL, NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, DISCORD_CLIENT_ID, DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET, BLOXLINK_API_KEY, JWT_SECRET

UX / pages

Landing page

Clear value proposition and CTA: “Connect with Discord”.

Show the purple theme and project icon.

Login/Connect

"Sign in with Discord" using OAuth2 (NextAuth).

Dashboard (after login)

Server selector (list servers the user can manage via Discord OAuth scopes).

Report generator UI (search Roblox users via Bloxlink, generate a shareable report).

Widgets: server stats, recent activity, queued requests.

Bot management panel:

Option A: Invite an official bot via an OAuth2 invite link (if we provide a bot).

Option B (user-owned bot): allow users to register their own bot by having their bot call an authenticated webhook (bot sends bot_id and an HMAC or secret it stores). This must not involve sharing Discord user tokens.

Customization panel: let user change accent color (select from provided purple palette) and toggle features.

Admin / Logs page

Per-server logs, request history, and simple analytics.

Settings

API keys, webhooks, rate limit configuration, theme settings.

Bloxlink integration

Implement core integration to call Bloxlink endpoints (assume BLOXLINK_API_KEY env var).

Provide endpoints in the backend:

GET /api/bloxlink/user/:robloxIdOrName → returns Bloxlink data

POST /api/bloxlink/batch → batch lookup of up to X users (with queued handling)

Create a client-side component to display Bloxlink results in a readable report (avatar, username, links to Roblox profile, any moderation flags the API provides).

Bot connectivity — explicit and safe

Do NOT accept or store anyone’s Discord user token.

Support two safe ways:

OAuth2 Invite (recommended): Provide a generated invite link for a bot client ID with required permissions. Explain how site owners can deploy a bot and set BOT_TOKEN in their own hosting. Provide code that demonstrates a server bot that uses Discord.js and subscribes to webhooks from the dashboard.

Bot registration webhook (for user-owned bots): User-hosted bot can POST /api/register-bot with bot_id and a pre-shared registration_secret. The backend stores a hashed secret and a callback URL. The bot must prove ownership (HMAC signature on payload). Document how to run the bot locally and register it — all without ever submitting a Discord user token through the site.

Document the tradeoffs and steps in README.

Design / theme

Purple palette (use these hexs): #6B21A8, #8B5CF6, #A78BFA, accent #7C3AED, background #0F172A, text #EDE9FE

Use the provided icon throughout (favicon, header, login).

Create a responsive dashboard that looks great on mobile and desktop.

Database models (minimum)

User (id, discordId, displayName, avatar, createdAt)

Server (id, discordServerId, name, ownerId, settings JSON, createdAt)

BotRegistration (id, botId, ownerUserId, webhookUrl, secretHash, createdAt)

BloxRequests (id, userId, serverId, query, resultSummary, createdAt)

ApiKeys (id, serverId, keyHash, scopes, createdAt)

APIs & Rate limiting

Implement request throttling per-user and per-server (simple token bucket or express-rate-limit).

Provide a small API key generation flow for server owners to use server-level API access.

Devops & README

README must include:

Full env var list and what they do.

How to register a Discord app and set OAuth2 redirect URIs.

How to obtain a BLOXLINK_API_KEY (placeholder instructions).

How to register a bot and the recommended invite URL.

How to run migrations and start the app locally (dev).

How to deploy (Vercel + external Postgres example).

Security checklist (never log tokens, rotate secrets, HTTPS).

Deliverables

Fully working repo with code for frontend & backend.

Prisma schema + migration.

Example .env.example file.

README documenting flows (especially bot registration webhook and OAuth2).

Minimal tests to prove endpoints work (e.g., one test for Bloxlink proxy endpoint).

Simple seed script adding a demo user and demo server for quick testing.

Extra (nice-to-have)

Dark/light toggle, but default dark with purple accents.

Invite/shareable report links (public, expiring).

Export CSV for request logs.

Small analytics chart on dashboard (request volume over time).

Option to set custom domain per server.

Acceptance criteria (what I will test)

I can log in with Discord OAuth2.

I can view my servers and open a dashboard for a server I own.

I can query the Bloxlink endpoint and see results rendered as a report.

I can register a user-hosted bot via the secure webhook method and it appears in the bot panel.

Code includes README and runs locally following steps.
